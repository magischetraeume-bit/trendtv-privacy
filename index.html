Thank you for using TrendTV.
 This Privacy Policy explains what information the app collects, how it is used, and how your data is protected.

TrendTV does not collect, store, share, or sell any personal data.
The app does not request or process:

TrendTV can be fully used without registration and without creating any user profile.
2. Advertising (Google AdMob)

You can reset or disable your device’s advertising ID at any time in the Android settings.
3. Children’s Privacy
The app includes an optional age selection to adjust ad categories (kids, teens, adults), but no personal data is collected, even from users under 18.
TrendTV follows all Google Play rules for:
child-safe apps
restricted advertising categories
4. No Data Storage or External Servers
TrendTV does not operate a cloud database or backend server. The app does not upload or store any user information externally.
All settings and preferences stay only on the device.
